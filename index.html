    <p><strong>Safe Agricultural Products and Water Graph (SAWGraph)</strong>: An <b>Open Knowledge Network </b> to Monitor and Trace PFAS and Other Contaminants in the Nation's Food and Water Systems
    </p>
    <p><a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2333782"><i>A ProtoOKN project</i></a></p>
    <p>The goal of SAWGraph is to onnect federal and other datasets to more quickly analyze data and make decisions around  Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) sources, testing, impacts, and risks
      The graph will integrate data data and provide interfaces that support analysis, mapping and communication of the results of testing for PFAS contamination, spatial connections to known and potential sources to support PFAS research and decision making around PFAS testing and mitigation. 
The primary end users of SAWGraphs are personnel at state and federal agencies who monitor the environment and the safety of drinking water and agricultural land and products. End users include but are not limited to personnel at EPA and state environmental protection agencies (e.g. state environmental toxicologists) and at USDA and state agricultural agencies. Other potential users include experts from FDA, USGS and similar state agencies.  
We distinguish four types of users based on their primary responsibility: (1) drinking water monitoring; (2) understanding the extent and sources of environmental contamination with PFAS; (3) PFAS researchers; (4) environmental justice.
The graph is expected to empower these users to: (1) formulate and implement comprehensive test plans aimed at monitoring elevated PFAS levels in drinking water or agricultural lands, (2) pinpoint the most significant sources of PFAS in a state and how it impacts disadvantaged communities; (3) identify populations at elevated risk and prioritize testing resources and support accordingly; (4) design contamination management and remediation plana; and (5) identify research gaps in knowledge about PFAS fate and transport. Collectively, these applications will expedite comprehension of PFAS contamination and its mitigation, while ensuring the efficient and equitable allocation of testing and remediation resources.

        </ul>
      <li><b>Trace Contamination:</b> Where does the PFAS end up? Where does it originate from?
        <ul>
        <li>How do specific point sources like industrial facilities, landfills, firefighting training sites, or biosolid application sites affect their surroundings?</li>
        <li>What potential sources are upstream from concerning test results?</li>
        <li>What do the test results downstream from a potential point source show?, see <a href="testing.html">Contaminant Tracing Example Use Case</a></li>
        <li>What water wells downstream from or connected to sites with concerning levels should be prioritized for testing?</li>
      </ul>
      <li><b>Research: What linkages does the data suggest? What warrants further research?</b> 
        <ul>
        <li>Where are unexplained high test results?</li>

        <li>What connections are between different PFAS substances in the environment?</li>
